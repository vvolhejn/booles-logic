# Boole's logic

Boole's logic (not Boolean logic!) in a Jupyter notebook.
Final "essay" for the ETH ZÃ¼rich course _History of Formal Logic: The Emergence of Boolean Logic_ taught by Juan Luis Gastaldi.

The work is a Jupyter notebook implementing Boole's logic framework in code, along with an associated textual analysis.
