# Boole, Arithmetic and Python Syllogisms

Final "essay" for the ETH ZÃ¼rich course _History of Formal Logic: The Emergence of Boolean Logic_ taught by Juan Luis Gastaldi.

The work is a Jupyter notebook implementing Boole's logic framework from his 1847 book, _Mathematical Analysis of Logic_.
The notebook includes an associated textual analysis of the book, specifically the role of arithmetic manipulations of elective equations.
